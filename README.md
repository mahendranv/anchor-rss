[![JitPack](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/mahendranv/anchor-rss?color=green&label=JitPack&logo=hackthebox&logoColor=white&style=for-the-badge)](https://jitpack.io/#mahendranv/anchor-rss) ![](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/mahendranv/anchor-rss?style=for-the-badge)

WIP ðŸš§: A simple java-lib backed by Jackson XML parser.

## Usage

Add gradle dependency to the project. Make sure to add the jitpack repo to maven repos list.
```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.mahendranv:anchor-rss:{latest-version}'
}
```

Call the parser with feed URL.
```java
String feedXmlUrl = "https://anchor.fm/s/e337170/podcast/rss";
AnchorResult result = AnchorParser.parse(strUrl);
switch (result.getStatusCode()) {
    case SUCCESS:
        String podcastTitle = result.getRss().getChannel().getTitle();
        List<Item> episodes = result.getRss().getChannel().getItems();
    break;
    case IO_EXCEPTION:
        // Connectivity error
    break;
    case INVALID_URL:
        // Malformed url
    break;
    case PARSER_FAILURE:
        // Parser failure
    break;
}
```
